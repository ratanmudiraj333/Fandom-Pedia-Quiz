    description:"Johnny was once the troubled rich kid of the Valley who started a feud with the new kid Daniel LaRusso, which went on for over thirty-years. His vicious training in martial arts by John Kreese made him a formidable opponent, and he was the top student at the Cobra Kai dojo. After losing the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament, Johnny's life turned upside down and remained that way into his adulthood, and he became the estranged father of Robby Keene. In an attempt to reclaim his life, Johnny reopens Cobra Kai Dojo and becomes a sensei to an entirely new generation of students."

He co-founded the first Cobra Kai Dojo alongside Kreese, serving as the original corporate owner of the dojo. He later helped enact revenge on Daniel LaRusso after Kreese's humiliation in the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament. Silver hatched an elaborate, time-consuming, and expensive plot to trick Daniel into training with him. He planned Daniel's loss in the All Valley Karate Tournament, to redeem Cobra Kai. His plan failed, and the dojo closed."
